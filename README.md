## The spin

I'm working on a *special* program for everyone soon.
I'm learning how to make Operating Systems so I can soon learn how to make one for everyone. Kids, Adults, Disabled, Blind, Deaf, and people with no time. Windows users, Linux users, Macintosh users, and even people who have never used a computer before. Simple installation, simple use. Advanced/server use for when we start designing physical computers. We plan to make the most lightweight, and simple OS and computer, much like raspberry pi. But we gotta wait 7 years to start making physical computers.
